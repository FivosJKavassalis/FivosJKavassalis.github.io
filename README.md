## OBJECTIVE
Full-time job in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science or Robotics Engineering
## EDUCATION
#### Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)                                            May 2020
Major in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Minor in Computer Science              GPA: 3.82
## EXPERIENCE
#### Embedded Software Intern, Bose Corporation                       MA June 2019 -August 2019
• Developed a plug and play automation tool (lightweight framework) in Python for easy deployment that performs common mobile functions and had Bluetooth connectivity and monitoring capabilities

• Serialized AT commands that are inputted to a GSM module and are exploited by a client-server setup for RPC processing (RPyC, Pyserial) 

• Automated firmware flashing for devices under test using the Qualcomm USB Debug driver to improve timing, reliability and recoverability of updating test devices with new firmware and ensure independence between nightly test runs

#### MIT Sea Grant Lab Intern, MIT, MA                                    May 2018 – August 2018
https://github.com/FivosJKavassalis/MIT_SeaGrant_Drifter

• Developed and implemented electronic part of a variation of the Lagrangian drifting vehicle by establishing satellite
(RockBLOCK/Iridium SBD) and other wireless communications (LoRa Radio) equipped with sensors measuring water
parameters, a GPS and an IMU (through I2C, UART) to support research in ocean acidification

## PROJECTS
#### Major Qualifying Project (MQP), WPI                                September 2019 – May 2020
• Design a flexible, wearable sensor (PPG sensor) that will detect heart rate, respiratory rate, and Sp02 of subject

• Process sensor data through microcontroller (ESP32), extracted and sent wirelessly (Bluetooth) to our Android application

• Create Android application to clearly display and analyse data in order to provide health recommendations to the user

#### ECE Design Project: Habit Helper, WPI                                   March 2019-April 2019
• Built a prototype of a wireless, wearable device which aids the user in correcting poor posture and low physical activity

• Collected measurements from accelerometer which are processed by an Arduino Nano microcontroller to calculate statistics
and provide helpful reminders to the user that will be sent wirelessly (Bluetooth) to our application

• Created smart phone application to show user’s health results and notify them of their condition

#### ECE Communications Project: Search and Pick a Seat (SPAS), WPI            April 2018-May 2018
https://github.com/FivosJKavassalis/ECE2305_Team14

• Designed/implemented an IoT system comprising of a wireless network with an aggregator node and multiple sensor nodes
(TDMA, TTL w/ ultrasonic sensor) connected to the Internet, to obtain information on availability of library cubicles
(403MHz RF transmitters/receivers) and share it to the web (Blink web sharing)

#### Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), WPI                                  Oct 21-Dec 15 2018
https://sites.google.com/site/ve18bells 
• Designed/Implemented a methodology to evaluate structural integrity in bell towers in Venice, Italy based on analysis of
motion caused by inertial forces due to bell swinging (AxisVM, Accelerometers and FFT Analysis w/ MATLAB)

• Developed a web app (React) to collect and present data about Venetian bells and bell towers
